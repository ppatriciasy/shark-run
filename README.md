# Shark: Run
Shark: Run is a game for PC with 10 levels where each shark level will increase and the game will become more difficult. Use the arrow keys to move and avoid the sharks from reaching the coral reef. Finish the game before the music ends with as few deaths as possible.

To run this program, you must download the application extension file called "nw.dll" on gdrive (I didn't include it on this github because the file is large so it can't be uploaded) or you can try running it from your personal computer, download and extract the file via the following link https://bit.ly/shark-run
